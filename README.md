# Android Easy File Transfer (AEFT)

# AEFT is undergoing a major rework at the moment. All current builds are to be considered unstable.

Android Easy File Transfer (or AEFT) is an easy way to send files
from your Android mobile device to Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X
systems running Java 8. While there are other file transfer apps
out there, they come loaded with extra software and are packed
with ads. AEFT is FOSS, so it will always be free with no ads or
extra software.

AEFT Desktop is compatible with both 32 bit and 64 bit systems.
It can run on any device that has Java.

The AEFT Android app is compatible with any Android device running
Android 4.4 (KitKat) or higher.

**How To Use**
1. Ensure your computer is running Java 8 or later.
2. Open the AEFT.jar file on your computer.
3. Enter the EXACT path where you want your file saved, as well as
   the file NAME and EXTENSION.
   i.e. C:\Users\John\Desktop\MyPicture.jpg
   The file name doesn't have to match the device, but the extension
   must.
4. Click the button the start the server. If a message box pops up,
   the server is running. If not, quit the application and try again.
5. On your device, open the AEFT app.
6. Select the file you want to send and enter the server IP address
   (this is displayed on the server application), but also make sure
   both devices are on the same network (for port forwarding, use
   port 25000).
7. Click Send.
8. If the desktop application closes and your file appears where
   you saved it, it was successful.
