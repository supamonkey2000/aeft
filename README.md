# Android Easy File Transfer (AEFT)

Android Easy File Transfer (or AEFT) is an easy way to send files
from your Android mobile device to Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X
systems running Java 8. While there are other file transfer apps
out there, they come loaded with extra software and are packed
with ads. AEFT is FOSS, so it will always be free with no ads or
extra software.

AEFT Desktop is compatible with both ARM, 32 bit, and 64 bit systems.
It can run on any device that has Java.

The AEFT Android app is compatible with any Android device running
Android 4.4 (KitKat) or higher.
