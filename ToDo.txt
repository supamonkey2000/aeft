TO DO LIST

(Currently all list items are Windows/Android only)

1. Send file name before sending file.
2. ^ Try to get the Username so setting the path is easier
3. ^ Create a new folder called AEFT in Documents if it doesn't already exist
4. Display thumbnails in the OpenFileActivity on Android instead of needing to tap them.
